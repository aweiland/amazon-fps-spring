amazon-fps-spring
=================

Amazon FPS Spring support.

So the Amazon people missed a little bit on the FPS API.  This project helps to fix of some of the problems they made.
Mainly how it's configured.  I'll write some more docs later.  Just initializing the project at the moment.

This project depends upon the mavenized version of the FPS API at :
